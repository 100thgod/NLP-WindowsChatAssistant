# NLP-WindowsChatAssistant

This is a small project based on Python. It works on recognizing your voice . You can search about any random stuff using 
your voice. You must specify the thing by saying "What is 'keyword'". It searches the wikipedia and says and displays the 
first 5 lines. 

You can open Windows applications by saying Open followed by the appllication name. For example, if you say open notepad, 
it will open Notepad. 
Note: You will have to change the location of the applicaion based on your application location, in the python code.
